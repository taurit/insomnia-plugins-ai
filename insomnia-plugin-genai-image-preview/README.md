# insomnia-plugin-genai-image-preview

This simple plugin opens preview dialog displaying images returned by the GenAI endpoints.

It supports displaying multiple images (one below another, with a scrollbar) for batch requests that return more than one.

## Auto-detected and supported endpoints:

- AUTOMATIC1111's [Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) txt2img API

## Contribution

My personal usage of Generative AI Image APIs is limitd to Stable Diffusion and Dall-E, and I'm unlikely to add support for other endpoints.

If you want to see something else supported, then please:

- Create a GitHub issue with a feature suggestion (please describe as detailed as you can)
- Or modify the plugin code and share the solution via a PR :)
